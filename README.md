# BCI-2023-Workshop_Learning-from-small-datasets

Int. BCI Meeting Brussels / La Hulpe: Workshop W6, Wed., June 7, 9:30am- 12:30pm, Max Theatre, room Imbuia

Collection of materials and links to talks given, tools presented, software demos etc.

## Description:

Training up a decoding model based on as few possible training data points as possible is a desirable goal, as it can be pivotal for the usability of a BCI application with patients, for the acceptance by healthy users, or to realize fast adaptations during non-stationary recordings or for transferring between sessions. Our workshop addresses the latest proposed techniques to train classification or regression machine learning models with small datasets, embracing approaches from both, traditional machine learning approaches and deep learning approaches. In addition to talks and discussions, we will have a hands-on programming session in Python to benchmark different classification models.
